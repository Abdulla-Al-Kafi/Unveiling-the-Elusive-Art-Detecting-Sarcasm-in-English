# Unveiling the Elusive Art: Detecting Sarcasm in English

## Overview
Detecting sarcasm in written text is a challenging task due to its linguistic complexity. This project applies **machine learning** and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques, utilizing **LSTM** and **GRU** models with **GloVe embeddings** to improve sarcasm detection accuracy.

## Features
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Uses pre-trained **GloVe word embeddings** for contextual understanding.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implements **LSTM** and **GRU** models for sarcasm detection.
- **Comprehensive Performance Evaluation**: Assesses effectiveness using **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.
- **Curated Datasets**: Trained on high-quality sarcasm-labeled datasets.

## Dataset
The project utilizes **public sarcasm detection datasets**, where sarcastic and non-sarcastic statements undergo preprocessing, including tokenization, stemming, and vectorization with **GloVe embeddings**.

## Model Architecture
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Captures long-range dependencies in text.
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: A lightweight alternative to LSTM, optimizing computation.
- **Embedding Layer**: Uses pre-trained GloVe embeddings for better word representation.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Classifies text into sarcastic and non-sarcastic categories.

## Results & Metrics
Performance is evaluated using:
- **Precision**: Measures detected sarcastic statements' accuracy.
- **Recall**: Measures the detection rate of actual sarcastic statements.
- **F1-score**: Balances precision and recall.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **transformer-based models** like BERT.
- Expand dataset diversity to include various dialects.
- Develop a **real-time sarcasm detection API**.
